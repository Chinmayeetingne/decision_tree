# Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores a dataset related to heart disease to identify key factors contributing to heart disease and develop an understanding of the data through visualization and statistical analysis.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Heart Disease dataset, which includes various health metrics such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular health indicators. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify patterns and factors that influence the likelihood of heart disease.

Key Objectives

1) Data Understanding: Explore and visualize the features of the dataset to gain insights.
2) Feature Selection: Identify important features that correlate with heart disease.
3) Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.
4) Visualization: Use graphs and plots to visualize relationships between features and heart disease.
5) Statistical Analysis: Analyze the significance of features using statistical methods.

Dataset

The dataset contains medical and health-related attributes for patients, along with a target variable indicating whether or not a patient has heart disease.

Features:

Age: Patient's age in years.

Sex: Male or Female (1 = Male, 0 = Female).

Chest Pain Type: 4 categories of chest pain experienced.

Resting Blood Pressure: Measured in mm Hg.

Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.

Fasting Blood Sugar: Whether fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = True, 0 = False).

Resting ECG: Results of the electrocardiogram test.

Max Heart Rate: Maximum heart rate achieved.

Exercise Induced Angina: Whether angina occurred during exercise.

Oldpeak: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

ST Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.

Heart Disease: Target variable (1 = Presence of heart disease, 0 = Absence of heart disease).

Tools and Technologies

* Python: Core programming language for data analysis.
* Jupyter Notebook: Used to write and document code interactively.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* Seaborn/Matplotlib: For visualizing data.
* Scikit-learn: For statistical analysis and model building.


Key Findings

1.Age and Max Heart Rate show significant correlation with the presence of heart disease.

2.Chest Pain Type provides key insights into the likelihood of heart disease.

3.Patients with higher cholesterol levels and resting blood pressure are more prone to heart disease.

Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing heart disease, which could be used for further predictive modeling and prevention strategies.

Future Work

1. Modeling: Use machine learning models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict heart disease based on key features.
2. Feature Engineering: Explore additional transformations and feature combinations to improve prediction accuracy.
